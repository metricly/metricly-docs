| Elevated RDS CPU Activity (Normal Network Activity) | 30 min   | metricly.aws.rds.cpuutilization has an upper baseline deviation + an upper contextual deviation + a static threshold  > 20 | metricly.aws.rds.networkreceivethroughput does not have an upper baseline deviation +  does not have a upper contextual deviation | metricly.aws.rds.networktransmitthroughput does not have a upper baseline deviation + does not have a upper contextual deviation | INFO     | Increases in CPU activity are not uncommon when there is a rise in network activity. Increased traffic to a server means more work for that server to do. This policy is designed to catch cases where CPU activity is higher than than normal, and said behavior cannot be explained by a corresponding increase in network traffic. It may or may not represent a problem, but it is useful to know about. |

| Elevated RDS Latency                                | 30 min   | metricly.aws.rds.readlatency has an upper baseline deviation + an upper contextual deviation                               | metricly.aws.rds.writelatency has an upper baseline deviation + an upper contextual deviation                                     | metricly.aws.rds.totalthroughput has a static threshold ≥ 1,000                                                                  | CRITICAL | This policy will generate a Critical event when both read and write latency is higher than normal for half an hour or longer. Note that there must also be a minimum number of requests for this policy to trigger; this is because with too few requests, the average can tend to be skewed by outliers. The default request threshold is 1,000; you may wish to tune this for your environment.            |
