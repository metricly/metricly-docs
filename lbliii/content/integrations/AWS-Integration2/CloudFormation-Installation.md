This installation method leverages a CloudFormation script found in step 1.4. After you make a new AWS integration in Metricly, the script populates a read-only IAM role in your AWS account and links it using the integrationâ€™s Account ID and External ID. Once created, it may take a few minutes for the status to be updated.

Create an AWS Integration in Metricly
1. Open Metricly and navigate to Integrations > AWS.
2. Create a new AWS integration. Ensure that the below tabled properties are set according to your needs.

6. Click **Create Role**.
