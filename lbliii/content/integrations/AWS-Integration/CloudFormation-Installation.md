This installation method leverages a CloudFormation script found in step 1.4. After you make a new AWS integration in Metricly, the script populates a read-only IAM role in your AWS account and links it using the integrationâ€™s Account ID and External ID. Once created, it may take a few minutes for the status to be updated.

## Create an AWS Integration in Metricly  
1. Open Metricly and navigate to Integrations > AWS.  
2. Create a new AWS integration. Ensure that the below tabled properties are set according to your needs.

| AWS Toggle   | Description |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| CostExplorer | Captures billing data. This should only be enabled on 1 AWS account, the master billing data account. |
| CloudWatch   | Enable the CloudWatch toggle to monitor performance data. This can be done on multiple accounts. |

3. For AWS Authentication, select **IAM Role**.

5. Check **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources**.  
6. Click **Create Role**.

7. It may take a few minutes to create the role. When ready, the status turns green.

## Add Role ARN to the New AWS Integration
1. In the AWS console, navigate to **Services** > **IAM** > **Roles**.  
2. Find the role created in the previous section using the search bar.

3. Expand **Outputs** and copy the **Role ARN**.  
 - Do **not** copy the _Stack ID_. The Role ARN looks like: `arn:aws:iam::<account-number>:role/<Metricly-Role-Name>`
4. Return to the Metricly.   
5. Input the Role ARN into **IAM Role ARN**.
