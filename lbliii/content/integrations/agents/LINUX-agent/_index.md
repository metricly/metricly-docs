Using the Linux Agent, you can quickly deploy and collect metrics with a rich set of metadata.

The agent discovers and collects KPI metrics, integrates with CloudWatch, and can leverage other agent metrics. Using various plugins, the Linux Agent can also pull metrics from many different products running on a Linux operating system (in addition to pulling metrics from the host Linux OS).

## Upgrade Your Linux Agent
It’s important you upgrade to the latest version of the Linux Agent whenever possible, as we’re constantly improving it. Check out the recently closed issues and pull requests, as well as the release history, to see why you should upgrade.
