      <description>Top Violators reports display the elements in your environment that have triggered the most events within the specified Time Frame setting, allowing you to quickly locate the elements with high event counts. This report provides the same type of data as the Event Explorer, but the data is grouped by element.
 Summary Table: This table provides both the number of events triggered by each element (Event Count), and the amount of time that each element triggered events within the specified Time Frame.</description>
