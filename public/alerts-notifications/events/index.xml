      <description>The following tools allow you to view and analyze events in the Metricly UI:
 Event Explorer: Event Explorer displays a comprehensive list of all the events in your environment. You can filter the list by the event category, source (Metricly or External), element, element type, and/or tag of the element(s) to which an event is associated. You can also filter events within a specific time frame. For more information about Event Explorer, see below.</description>

      <description>Through a combination of SNS Notifications, Metriclyâ€™s Webhook integration, and an external event conditions policy filter, you can push event logs from your AWS services to Metricly and act on them in the UI. This works across several AWS services. Once set up, these logs can be divided further on the policy level (through matching value strings in the log message and categorized by severity). Policies for your event logs can also be set up with various notifications through email, slack, and others.</description>
