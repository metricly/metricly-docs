      <description>How to Enable Detailed Billing  If you already have an S3 bucket receiving billing files from Amazon, then you do not need to complete steps 1 and 2. You can go directly to step 3 to provide Metricly access to the existing files. If you have already created an S3 bucket, you will not need to create a separate one. Just be sure to select the correct S3 bucket in step 2.</description>
