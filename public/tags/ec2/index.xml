      <title>Cost Reports</title>

      <description>Cost reports enable you to easily identify expensive instances and compare them against utilization, type, elements, and tags. These multi-dimensional reports also break down information like total versus individual instance costs and even how much each instance state (Reserved, On-Demand) costs. Custom tagging is another easy way to group your instances.
Cost Reports are generated once per week. It may take up to 7 days before your first report is available.</description>

      <title>EC2 Recommendations</title>

      <description>The EC2 Recommendation report is designed to help you reduce EC2 instance running costs by suggesting alternative instance types that may provide a similar level of service at a lower cost. The report presents details on the current EC2 instance types and their respective memory, VCPUs, and hourly instance running costs. Using these characteristics and the utilization observed during the reporting period, it estimates the memory and number of VCPUs that are actually needed, subject to optional constraints such as CPU utilization not exceeding a particular level, etc.</description>
