      <description>The Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Recommendations report provides a summary of the EC2 instance hours managed by all of your Auto Scaling Groups over the past few weeks. The data is summarized by hour and day for the preceding one-to-four weeks depending on how long Metricly has been monitoring the ASG.  Total Instance Count graph: This graph depicts the average total number of instances managed by all of your ASG(s) by hour and day.</description>

      <description>Cost reports enable you to easily identify expensive instances and compare them against utilization, type, elements, and tags. These multi-dimensional reports also break down information like total versus individual instance costs and even how much each instance state (Reserved, On-Demand) costs. Custom tagging is another easy way to group your instances.
Cost Reports are generated once per week. It may take up to 7 days before your first report is available.</description>

      <description>The EC2 Recommendation report is designed to help you reduce EC2 instance running costs by suggesting alternative instance types that may provide a similar level of service at a lower cost. The report presents details on the current EC2 instance types and their respective memory, VCPUs, and hourly instance running costs. Using these characteristics and the utilization observed during the reporting period, it estimates the memory and number of VCPUs that are actually needed, subject to optional constraints such as CPU utilization not exceeding a particular level, etc.</description>

      <description>The Resource Utilization report uses boxplots to provide simple visualizations of each of your elementâ€™s utilization. The types of boxplots shown are controlled by optional filters. Filters allow you to narrow the elements displayed by element name, element type, element tags, and element attributes.
Boxplots are a standard way of displaying a distribution of data based on five values: the minimum, the lower quartile (25th percentile), the median, the upper quartile (the 75th percentile), and the maximum.</description>
