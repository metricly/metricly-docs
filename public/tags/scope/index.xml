Scope Methods When using multiple fields, an element must meet each criterion to be included in the policyâ€™s scope.

      <description>A policy is a set of conditional tests used to set custom rules for when Metricly will generate an event or other notifications. In other words, policies allow you to define various types of abnormal element behavior, then notify you when that abnormal behavior occurs.
Use the Policy Editor to add, edit, enable, disable, or delete policies.
A policy is made up of a scope, condition(s), duration, and notification(s).
 The Scope defines the element or elements to which a policy is applied.</description>
