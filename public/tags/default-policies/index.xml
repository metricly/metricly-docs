      <description>Before reading about the EBS default policy, it is important to understand the following Metricly computed metrics.
 Average Latency: Average Latency is straightforward as it represents the average amount of time that it takes for a disk operation to complete. Queue Length Differential: Queue Length Differential measures the difference between the actual disk queue length and the “ideal” disk queue length.The ideal queue length is based on Amazon’s rule of thumb that for every 200 IOPS you should have a queue length of 1.</description>

      <description>Default policies are created by Metricly and intended to provide recommendations for ways to monitor the behavior of the elements in your environment. Default policies can be found on the Policies page and are marked as Metricly in the Created By column. You can edit default policies as needed to suit the behavior of your environment. When new default policies are provisioned to your account, Metricly will not overwrite any changes you made to existing default policies.</description>

      <description>Before reading about these default policies, note that both the Elevated User CPU and Elevated System CPU policies assume that the CPU Collector is configured to collect aggregate CPU metrics, rather than per core metrics.
It also assumes that the metrics are being normalized. This is done by setting the percore setting set to FALSE (it is TRUE by default) and the normalize setting set to TRUE (it is FALSE by default) in your configuration file.</description>
