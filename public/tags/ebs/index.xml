      <description>Before reading about the EBS default policy, it is important to understand the following Metricly computed metrics.
 Average Latency: Average Latency is straightforward as it represents the average amount of time that it takes for a disk operation to complete. Queue Length Differential: Queue Length Differential measures the difference between the actual disk queue length and the “ideal” disk queue length.The ideal queue length is based on Amazon’s rule of thumb that for every 200 IOPS you should have a queue length of 1.</description>
