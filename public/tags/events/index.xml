      <description>New to Metricly? Use this page as an overview for the features related to Alerts, Events, Policies, and Notifications. For a more technical walkthrough on each, see our related articles.
Alerts Alerts are a continuous series of events. They group anomalous behavior and enable you to view open (active) or closed (inactive) incidents. The Open Policies list is the first you see when navigating to the Alerts menu. This list is updated every 30 seconds.</description>

      <title>Alerts Page</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/alerts-page/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/alerts-page/</guid>
      <description>The Alerts page shows a list of all your configured policies, both enabled and disabled. It includes:
 Policy name Number of elements in scope Filters on the policy State of the policy (Enabled/Disabled) Current status (OK, Info, Warning, Critical).  This page has additional filters to display all Open and Closed policies.
 Filtering by Open will display only the policies that are currently (Now) violating a set condition(s).</description>

      <title>Choose Duration</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/policies/choose-duration/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/policies/choose-duration/</guid>
      <description>Duration is the consecutive length of time for which all the conditions in a policy must be met before an event or other optional notification is created. The default setting for metric condition duration is 5 minutes; the default (and only) setting for external event condition duration is real-time. Because Metricly aggregates data on five-minute cycles, the duration for metric conditions must be at least 5 minutes.
By setting the duration of ExamplePolicy X to 10 minutes, an event will not be created in Metricly until all the conditions in ExamplePolicy X have been met for the same period of 10 consecutive minutes.</description>

      <title>Choose Scope</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/policies/choose-scope/</guid>
      <description>The scope of a policy defines which element(s) get assigned to that policy. A policy can use a combination of criterion to narrow its selection; for example, all elements tagged with region-east + EC2 as a type.
Scope Methods When using multiple fields, an element must meet each criterion to be included in the policy’s scope.
Name Contains or Name Excludes  Input a string of characters into the Name Contains or Name Excludes field.</description>

      <description>Through a combination of SNS Notifications, Metricly’s Webhook integration, and an external event conditions policy filter, you can push event logs from your AWS services to Metricly and act on them in the UI. This works across several AWS services. Once set up, these logs can be divided further on the policy level (through matching value strings in the log message and categorized by severity). Policies for your event logs can also be set up with various notifications through email, slack, and others.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/policies/create-conditions/</guid>
      <description>When you are creating conditions, the Policy Editor counts the number of metrics that apply to the conditions you have set. To view those metrics, click on the link. This link opens the list of matching metrics in a new tab.
Create a Metric Condition  Navigate to Alerts &amp;gt; New Policy &amp;gt; Conditions &amp;gt; Add Condition &amp;gt; Add Metric Condition.  To edit an existing policy, Navigate to Alerts &amp;gt; Show All Policies &amp;gt; Click Policy Name &amp;gt; Edit Policy &amp;gt; Conditions &amp;gt; Add Metric Conditions.</description>

      <title>Create External Event Conditions</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/policies/create-external-event-conditions/</guid>
      <description>External Event conditions for policies are typically used in conjunction with Webhook integrations. See the Webhook integration setup or Webhook API documentation for more information.
 Open Policy Editor. Click Conditions. Click Add Condition, then select Add External Event Condition.  Type into the fields to create a proper filter:  Message Contains: A regex statement that attempts to match a word or phrase in the event message. Title Contains: A regex statement that attempts to match a word or phrase in the event’s title.</description>

      <description>Create, edit, delete, enable, and disable policies with the Policy Editor. You can also use Policy Editor to enable and disable notifications.
 Open the Policy Editor. Navigate to Alerts &amp;gt; + Add New Policy. Begin crafting your policy at Step 1: Scope. You can also open an existing policy and click Edit Policy. Policies that correspond to inactive datasources cannot be edited.  The top of your policy has 3 important fields:</description>

      <title>Events</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/events/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/events/</guid>
      <description>Events indicate that a policy has been violated, meaning all of the policy conditions have been met for the set duration. In other words, events indicate that Metricly has detected anomalous behavior in one or more of the elements in your environment.
For example, if you create a policy for all EC2 elements with the condition CPU Utilization greater than 90% and a duration of 10 minutes, an event will be generated when an EC2 element’s CPU Utilization metric exceeds 90% for 10 consecutive minutes.</description>

      <title>Mute Policies</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/policies/mute-policies/</guid>
      <description>This silences all attached notifications for the policies selected for a set duration. You can manually unmute a policy at any time as well.
 Select all policies you wish to mute. Click Mute Notifications. Input a mute duration and click OK. Your selected policies will remain muted until your chosen duration expires or when you manually unmute them.  </description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/policies/</guid>
      <description>A policy is a set of conditional tests used to set custom rules for when Metricly will generate an event or other notifications. In other words, policies allow you to define various types of abnormal element behavior, then notify you when that abnormal behavior occurs.
Use the Policy Editor to add, edit, enable, disable, or delete policies.
A policy is made up of a scope, condition(s), duration, and notification(s).
 The Scope defines the element or elements to which a policy is applied.</description>

      <title>Regex Guide</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/policies/regex-guide/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/policies/regex-guide/</guid>
      <description>Use Regex to Match Metric Conditions Regex uses all metrics that contain your input value. Typing aws.elb.httpcode.* would match both aws.elb.httpcode_backend_2xx, as well as netuitive.aws.elb.httpcodebackenderrorpercent.
 Exclude computed metrics using a ^ before the start of a metric name. Use Metric Tags to select a tag to further filter your condition.  We recommend testing any regular expressions that you create at https://regexr.com.
 Match String Match the start and end of the string contained between ^ and $.</description>

      <title>Top Violators</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/top-violators/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/alerts-notifications/top-violators/</guid>
      <description>Top Violators reports display the elements in your environment that have triggered the most events within the specified Time Frame setting, allowing you to quickly locate the elements with high event counts. This report provides the same type of data as the Event Explorer, but the data is grouped by element.
 Summary Table: This table provides both the number of events triggered by each element (Event Count), and the amount of time that each element triggered events within the specified Time Frame.</description>

      <description>The following tools allow you to view and analyze events in the Metricly UI:
 Event Explorer: Event Explorer displays a comprehensive list of all the events in your environment. You can filter the list by the event category, source (Metricly or External), element, element type, and/or tag of the element(s) to which an event is associated. You can also filter events within a specific time frame. For more information about Event Explorer, see below.</description>
