      <description>Setting up an alert in Metricly requires the creation of a policy and the system checks are no exception. Any check coming into the system can have a corresponding alert as well as a notification.
 Click on policies and select New Policy. Name the policy and apply any scoping or filtering required (for example, narrowing the scope to WinServ in US-West region with Tag Environment:Production). Next click Conditions &amp;gt; Add Condition, and from the drop down you will see Add System Check Condition.</description>

      <description>Our platform is flexible to support any custom checks, but you will need a mechanism to schedule the scripts to run. Linux cron jobs or Window task scheduler will typically work for most cases. If you are running on the Linux platform our agent can also schedule the running of your scripts via the Users Scripts Integration. This option will allow you to schedule a script that may post to our REST API as output either a system check, or a time-series metric value, or even a text-based data.</description>

      <description>Leveraging our saved filters is a good way to find your checks. All checks are tagged with the key n.checks and value check name.
 Click Type and select either SERVER (for Linux) or WINSRV (for Windows) to pick where the check has been configured. Navigate to More &amp;gt; Tag and search for n.checks.  </description>
