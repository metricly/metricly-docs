Default policies are created by Metricly and intended to provide recommendations for ways to monitor the behavior of the elements in your environment. Default policies can be found on the Policies page and are marked as Metricly in the Created By column. You can edit default policies as needed to suit the behavior of your environment. When new default policies are provisioned to your account, Metricly will not overwrite any changes you made to existing default policies. Furthermore, any new default policies added to your account will be disabled by default.

Before reading about default policies, you first should understand the concepts of scope, conditions, duration, notifications, and event categories.
