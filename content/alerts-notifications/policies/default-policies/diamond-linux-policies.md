Before reading about these default policies, note that both the **Elevated User CPU** and **Elevated System CPU** policies assume that the `CPU Collector` is configured to collect aggregate CPU metrics, rather than per core metrics.

It also assumes that the metrics are being normalized. This is done by setting the percore setting set to `FALSE` (it is `TRUE` by default) and the normalize setting set to `TRUE` (it is `FALSE` by default) in your configuration file. After adjusting these settings, save the configuration file and restart the agent to apply the changes. See the [Linux agent][1] for more information.

| Linux – CPU Threshold Exceeded                | 15 min   | cpu.total.utilization.percent has a static threshold >95%                                                |                                                                                               | CRITICAL | The CPU on the SERVER instance has exceeded 95% for at least 15 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Linux – Elevated System CPU                   | 30 min   | metricly.linux.cpu.total.system.normalized has an upper baseline deviation + a static threshold ≥ 30%    |                                                                                               | INFO     | This policy will generate an Informational event when CPU usage by system processes is higher than normal, but only if the actual value is also above 30%. Customers typically don’t want to be informed of deviations in CPU behavior when the actual values are too low; you may want to tune the 30% threshold for your environment. |
| Linux – Elevated User CPU                     | 30 min   | metricly.linux.cpu.total.user.normalized has an upper baseline deviation + a static threshold ≥ 50%      |                                                                                               | INFO     | This policy will generate an Informational event when CPU usage by user processes is higher than normal, but only if the actual value is also above 50%. Customers typically don’t want to be informed of deviations in CPU behavior when the actual values are too low; you may want to tune the 50% threshold for your environment.   |
| Linux – Heavy CPU Load                        | 15 min   | metricly.linux.cpu.total.user.normalized has an upper baseline deviation + an upper contextual deviation | metricly.linux.loadavg.05.normalized has a static threshold > 2                               | CRITICAL | This is a CRITICAL event indicating that the server’s CPU is under heavy load, based upon upper deviations on CPU utilization percent and the normalized loadavg.05 metric being greater than 2. Rule of thumb is that the run queue size (represented by the loadavg) should not be greater than 2x the number of CPUs.                |
