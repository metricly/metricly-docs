| netuitive.aws.ebs.averagelatency          | This metric expresses the average latency per operation for this EBSinstance. This metric is useful for monitoring EBS performance andquality of service.Computation:(Total Read Time + Total Write Time) / (Read Ops +Write Ops)   | seconds           | yes  | yes  | no   | Elevated Queue Length Differential with Elevated Latency |
| netuitive.aws.ebs.iops                    | This metric expresses the total number of either read or writeoperations per second for this EBS instance. This metric is useful formonitoring EBS I/O activity.Computation: Total Ops / 300 | operations/second | yes  | yes  | no   |                                                          |
| netuitive.aws.ebs.busytimeiops            | This metric expresses the number of operations per second measured only over the time that the disk is actually busy. This can be useful indetermining the IOPS being achieved during bursts.Computation: Total Ops / (300 – floor(Idle Time))  | operations/second | yes  | no   | no |                                                        
|  netuitive.aws.ebs.queuelengthdifferential  |  This metric is measuring the difference between the actual queue lengthand the “ideal” queue length. The ideal queue length is based onAmazon’s rule of thumb that for every 200 IOPS you should have a queue length of 1. In theory, a well-optimized volume should have a queue length differential that tends to hover around 0. In practice, we have seen volumes with extremely low latency (< 0.0001) have queue length differentials that are higher than 0; presumably this is because the latency is much lower than Amazon is assuming for their rule of thumb. Even in these cases, the differential is a pretty steady number; hence an upper deviation in the differential would tend to indicate that the disk is not keeping up.Computation: Queue Length – (IOPS / 200) | difference  |  yes |  no | no  | Elevated Queue Length Differential with Elevated Latency  |
| netuitive.aws.ebs.iopsutilization  | This metric compares the current IOPS to the provisioned IOPS for thevolume in order to determine how much of the provisioned capacity isbeing used.Computation:min(100, (attribute[IOPS] == NULL ? data[IOPS] / 300 : data[IOPS / attribute[IOPS]]) *100)  | percent           | yes  | yes  | yes |    |

|netuitive.aws.ebs.queuelengthdifferential   | This metric is measuring the difference between the actual queue length and the “ideal” queue length. The ideal queue length is based on Amazon’s rule of thumb that for every 200 IOPS you should have a queue length of 1. In theory, a well-optimized volume should have a queue length differential that tends to hover around 0. In practice, we have seen volumes with extremely low latency (< 0.0001) have queue length differentials that are higher than 0; presumably this is because the latency is much lower than Amazon is assuming for their rule of thumb. Even in these cases, the differential is a pretty steady number; hence an upper deviation in the differential would tend to indicate that the disk is not keeping up.Computation: Queue Length – (IOPS / 200)   | difference  | yes  | no  |  no  | Elevated Queue Length Differential with Elevated Latency  |
