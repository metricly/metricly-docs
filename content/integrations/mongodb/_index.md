 MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database. CloudWisdom can be used to monitor your MongoDB’s performance.

## Prerequisites

The [Linux Agent][1] must be setup before you proceed with the MongoDB integration.

## Configure

1. Navigate to the collectors folder, `/opt/netuitive-agent/conf/collectors`.
2. Open the **MongoDBCollector.conf** file.
3. Change the **enabled** setting to `True`.
4. Replace the default host address and/or port number if necessary.
5. **Save** the configuration file, and **restart** the Linux Agent.

{{% notice info %}}
Due to the large number of metrics generated by MongoDB, you shouldn’t monitor more than one MongoDB host per agent.
