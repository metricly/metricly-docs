## Prerequisites

The [Linux Agent][1] is required before proceeding with the setup of JMX. If you need to disable the Linux integration or view the unique API key assigned to your account, navigate to the Integrations page under the user account drop-down menu and click the integration designated as Infrastructure under the Integration column.

## Configuration

1. Download the [Jolokia JVM JAR file](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/jolokia/jolokia-jvm/1.3.4/jolokia-jvm-1.3.4-agent.jar).
2. Move the downloaded file to the `/opt/netuitive-agent/` directory.
3. Restart your application with the following argument added where `port` and `host` indicate where the jolokia agent will be listening: `-javaagent:/opt/netuitive-agent/jolokia-jvm-1.3.4-agent.jar=port=8778,host=0.0.0.0`
4. Navigate to the **/opt/netuitive-agent/conf/collectors** folder.
5. Open the **JolokiaCollector.conf** file.
6. Change the **enabled** setting to `True`.
7. **Save** the configuration file and **restart** the Linux Agent.

## Example

We want to run the java application `hello-world.jar` located in `/opt/java` with the jolokia agent specified in the `-javaagent` option.

```
java -javaagent:/opt/netuitive-agent/jolokia-jvm-1.3.4-agent.jar=port=8778,host=0.0.0.0 -jar /opt/java/hello-world.jar
 ```
