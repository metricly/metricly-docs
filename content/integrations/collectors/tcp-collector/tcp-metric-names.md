| SyncookiesSent            | An application wasn’t able to accept a connection fast enough, so the kernel couldn’t store an entry in the queue for this connection. Instead of dropping it, it sent a cookie to the client.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| SyncookiesRecv            | After sending a cookie, it came back to us and passed the check.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| RcvPruned                 | If the kernel is really really desperate and cannot give more memory to this socket even after dropping the ofo queue, it will simply discard the packet it received. This is Really Bad.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| OfoPruned                 | When a socket is using too much memory (rmem), the kernel will first discard any out-of-order packet that has been queued (with SACK).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| ListenDrops               | We couldn’t accept a connection because one of: we had no route to the destination, we failed to allocate a socket, we failed to allocate a new local port bind bucket.

| TCPAbortOnSyn             | We received an unexpected SYN so we sent a RST to the peer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| TCPAbortOnData            | We were in FIN_WAIT1 yet we received a data packet with a sequence number that’s beyond the last one for this connection, so we RST’ed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| TCPAbortOnClose           | We received data but the user has closed the socket, so we have no wait of handing it to them, so we RST’ed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| TCPAbortOnMemory          | This is Really Bad. It happens when there are too many orphaned sockets (not attached a FD) and the kernel has to drop a connection.

| TCPAbortFailed            | We tried to send a reset, probably during one of teh TCPABort* situations above, but we failed e.g. because we couldn’t allocate enough memory (very bad).                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
