## This integration has been deprecated as of March 2019.

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform, similar to Amazon Web Services. With Azure integration in Metricly, you can monitor the performance of your entire cloud infrastructure. Metricly requires Reader role permissions of your Azure environment, which can be granted using the Owner or User Access Administrator roles.
