Azure Virtual Machines have a subset of core metrics by default. However, guest OS diagnostic metrics are needed for CloudWisdom's Azure cost reports. To enable guest OS diagnostic metrics, youâ€™ll need to follow the steps below.

## Enable Guest OS Diagnostic Metrics on an Existing VM
1. In Azure, navigate to **Virtual machines**.
2. Select a virtual machine. Another window with options will open.
3. Select **Diagnostic settings** under *Monitoring*.
4. Choose one of the existing Diagnostic storage accounts or create a new one. Note: Additional charges in Azure may apply.
5. Select the **Enable guest-level monitoring** button.
