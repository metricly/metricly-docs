Azure Virtual Machines will share boot diagnostic metrics by default, which are a small subset of core metrics. To enable Guest OS diagnostic (basic) metrics that provide more information about your machine, youâ€™ll need to follow these steps (depending on your situation):

## Enable Basic Metrics on Existing VM
1. In Azure, navigate to **Virtual machines**.
2. Select a virtual machine. Another window with options will open.
3. Select **Diagnostic settings**.
4. Under _Configure required settings_, select the checkbox next to **Basic metrics**. Metricly will now receive the basic VM metrics.

## Enabling basic metrics on a new VM
1. In Azure, navigate to **Virtual machines**.
2. At the top of the _Virtual machines_ window, click **Add**.
3. Select the type and create the instance.
4. Complete Steps 1 and 2 filling out the information as desired.
5. In Step 3, under _Monitoring_, enable **Guest OS diagnostics**.
6. Finish creating the VM. The basic metrics are now available in Metricly.
