## How to Upgrade
1. Download the latest Java agent [here](https://repos.app.netuitive.com/java-agent/index.html).
2. Copy the new `netuitive.jar` file to your existing Java agent files to replace the old netuitive.jar file.
3. Optionally, manually merge the new **zorka.properties** file with the old file to receive any new fields or settings.
