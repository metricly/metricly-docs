## Write Metric FQNs to Local File
If you want to keep a local file with a list of metric FQNs (fully qualified names), you can do so by updating the below lines in your `netuitive-agent.conf` file, under the ``[[NetuitiveHandler]]``. By default, this ability is set to False. When set to True, this file updates with any new FQNs as long as the agent is running.

If the agent is started and `write_metric_fqns` is set to `True`, the file is overwritten; it remains unchanged if set to False before starting the agent.

**To Enable:**  

1. Open your `netuitive-agent.conf` file.  
2. Change `write_metric_fqns = False` to `True`.  
3. Confirm your desired path (`metric_fqns_path`) for the file.  
4. **Save**.  

## Update the Hostname Manually
If you’re having issues with the default naming method or the hostname isn’t what you desire, you can manually set the hostname via the agent’s configuration file located at ``/opt/netuitive-agent/conf/netuitive-agent.conf``. Consult the table below for more information.

| Hard-coded                        | Force a hard-coded desired hostname.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Uncomment the hostname setting. ``# hostname = my_custom_hostname Replace my_custom_hostname`` with your desired hostname, keeping in mind that periods are common separators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| smart                             | The agent will initially try to use the short FQDN (fully qualifieddomain name). If the short FQDN is “localhost”, the agent will use the value returned by the hostname -s command.                                                                                       | Because smart is the default naming method, do not make changes to this section of the configuration file to continue using it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| fqdn (fully qualifed domain name) | Comprises three separate methods:fqdn_short, which is similar to the value returned by the hostname -scommand. fqdn, which is the fullhostname value. fqdn_rev, which is the full hostname value but reversed, e.g., com.example.www.                                      | Uncomment the hostname_method setting. ``# hostname_method = smart`` Replace smart with the desired fqdn setting.  `hostname_method = fqdn_rev`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| uname                             | Comprises two methods:uname_short, which is similar to the value returned by the `uname -n (network node hostname)` command but only the first portion. `uname_rev`, which is the value returned by the `uname -r (kernel release)` command but reversed, e.g., com.example.www. | Uncomment the hostname_method setting. Replace smart with the desired uname setting. `hostname_method = uname_short`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| hostname                          | Comprises three separate methods:hostname_short, which is the value returned by the hostname -scommand. hostname, which is the full hostname value. hostname_rev, which is the full hostname value but reversed, e.g., com.example.www.                                    | Uncomment the hostname_method setting.  ``# hostname_method = smart`` Replace smart with the desired hostnamesetting. `hostname_method = hostname`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| shell                             | Uses the string set in the hard-coded hostname variable as ashell command. The agent will use its output (with spaces trimmed from both ends) as the hostname.                                                                                                             | Uncomment the hostname setting. ``# hostname = my_custom_hostname`` Replace my_custom_hostname with your desired shell command. For example, with the following shell command you can use the AWS metadata endpoint to retrieve the instanceId and ensure uniqueness. `hostname = curl -sS "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id"` | xargs echo "$HOSTNAME -" Uncomment the hostname_method setting. ``# hostname_method = smart` Replace smart with shell. |
