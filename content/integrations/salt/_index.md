Chef is a configuration automation management software that allows you setup multiple servers using a few commands from a Chef server and workstation. The Metricly Agent cookbook will help you get the Metricly Linux Agent up and running on all of your nodes quickly.

## Configuration
If youâ€™ve managed to set up your Chef workstation, server, and nodes, check out our [open source Chef cookbook](https://github.com/netuitive/chef-netuitive#metricly-cookbook-chef) on Github, which will get you started on installing the Metricly Agent on all of your nodes.
