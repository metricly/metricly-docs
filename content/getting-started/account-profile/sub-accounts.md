## Manage Sub-Accounts

You can create Sub-Accounts if you need multiple, separate Metricly accounts under one Master Account. Sub-Accounts are created by adding a new admin user's login credentials and company name to your Sub-Account roster.

Sub-Accounts are not available by default. Contact your Metricly rep or submit a ticket to get access to Sub-Accounts.

3. Input a **First Name**, **Last Name**, and **Company**.
4. Provide an **Email** and **Password** for the admin user of the Sub-Account.

5. **Save** to create the Sub-Account and its first admin user.

All admin users in the parent account are able to assume the credentials of users in the sub-account and use Metricly as those users.
