3. Toggle any setting active (green) to enable.
  - **Shared**:  Makes dashboard public for each of the users under a tenant; users can edit and delete the dashboard if they wish without affecting the original dashboard.
  - **Fullscreen Mode**:
     - **Fullscreen**: Fullscreen Mode makes your dashboard(s) take up the entire screen.
     - **Rotate  Dashboards**: If you have fullscreen mode enabled, it will only rotate through your favorite dashboards if this option is selected.
     - **Rotation Period (sec)**: If Rotate  Dashboards is set to On, you can enable all of your dashboards to cycle through after a set number of seconds (the default is 60 seconds; the minimum is 20 seconds).
     - **Theater Mode**: Hides the top navigation menu.
