Favorited dashboards display as a drop-down list under Dashboards in the main top navigation menu.

## Favorite a Dashboard
1. Navigate to the Dashboard menu (or **Dashboard** > **Manage Dashboards**). A list of all the dashboards available in your tenant appears.
2. Click the **Star** icon next to a dashboard to favorite it.

## Unfavorite a Dashboard
Repeat the above process and click the **Star** icon to unfavorite the dashboard. This removes the dashboard from your quick drop-down list in the top navigation menu.
