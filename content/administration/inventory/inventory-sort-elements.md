Select two or more elements and then click **View Metrics** to open multiple elements on the Metrics page. The Elements table initially has six columns:

1. **Type**: Shows icon for an elementâ€™s type. You can see all the icons here.
2. **Name**: Name of the element.
3. **Data Collection**: The percentage of metrics that were collected in the last analytics cycle (5 minutes).If no metrics were collected, there could have been an issue with collection or too many metrics were collected, which forces Metricly to not collect any metrics.
5. **Collectors**: The names of the collector(s) currently enabled on the element.
6. **Created**: The date when the element was created in Metricly.
7. **Last Processed**: The last time and/or date each element was processed by Metricly
