## Visualization Options

You can visualize your data in two ways: via Period Comparison or Stacked View. Switching between views is easy!

### Period Comparison
Uses the current determined date interval (e.g. Latest 30 Days) and compares it to the previous interval (in this case, 30 days). See the Time Intervals section for more information on changing the periods compared.

### Stacked View
Shows all of your services individually; each service can be shown or hidden via toggling on the menu below the graph.
