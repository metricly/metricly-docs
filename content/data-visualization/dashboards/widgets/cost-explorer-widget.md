## Options

- **Top Limit:** Set a limit on the number of services represented in the visualization
- **Grouped By:** Choose between AWS Service, Account Id, or Availability Zone

## Time Range

Selecting a Time Range defines a scope in time the visualization uses to measure cost.

Using the Period Comparison visualization enables you to select a current timeframe (day, month, 6 months, etc) and compare its previous timeframe interval. For example, the below screenshot shows a _current_ 6 month period comparison of `May 16, 2018 – November 15, 2018` and a _previous_ 6 month interval of `November 16, 2017 – May 15, 2018`.
