Options for this widget type include: **period comparison**, **service total**, and **doughnut**.

The Period Comparison option enables you to select a current timeframe (day, month, 6 months, etc) and compare its previous timeframe interval. For example, the below screenshot shows a _current_ 6 month period comparison of `May 16, 2018 – November 15, 201`8 and a _previous_ 6 month interval of `November 16, 2017 – May 15, 2018`.
