 Metric charts offer functionality that allow you to **merge** two charts together, **move** charts around on the Metrics page dashboard, **zoom** in, and drop a **marker** on a data point.

## Merge Metric Charts
Click on the header of one metric chart and drag it on top of another chart into the green merge region. Click to unmerge the metric charts.

## Move Metric Charts
Click on the header of one metric chart and drag it into the blue move region located above a different chart. The chart will take the place of the chart to which it is dragged.

## Zoom in on a Chart
Click and drag across the area on a chart that you want to view.   

When you zoom in on one chart, Performance Explorer will automatically zoom in on all charts in the same location.

## Drop a Marker
Click on a chart in an area that aligns with a data point.  

When you drop a marker on one chart, Performance Explorer will automatically drop markers on all charts in the same location. You can only drop a marker on a chart if youâ€™re clicking outside of the Baseline and Contextual bands.
