Static Thresholds are unchanging levels that are compared against a metricâ€™s current value.

Create Static Threshold conditions in policies to use static thresholds to monitor the elements in your environment. If the value of a metric is greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, equal to, or not equal to the specified level of a Static Threshold condition (depending on the operator selected), then an event is generated.

For more information about using Static Threshold conditions, see Conditions.

## Static Threshold Example

If a Static Threshold level of greater than 80% is applied to a CPU utilization metric for a server element, then an event will be generated when the value of that metric is greater than 80%.
