Metricly uses advanced analytics to monitor your environment and proactively notify you when problems occur. There are 3 basic data types that Metricly uses to do so:  

- **Raw data**: Data collected from a third party integration that has not been interpreted, or _aggregated_, by Metricly. Because it has not been aggregated, raw data does not contribute to event creation.
- **Aggregate data**: Data collected from an integration that has been interpreted by Metricly. To generate aggregate data, Metricly averages the raw data collected from an integration at **5 minute intervals**. Aggregate data is used to represent a metric’s **actual value**.
- **Sparse data**: Data generated by Metricly when no data is collected from an integration for a given period of time. The value of sparse data is always 0.  

Metricly determines when a metric’s behavior is abnormal through the use of static thresholds, Baseline bands, and Contextual bands. In each case, the value of a metric is based on aggregate or sparse data. Raw data cannot be used to generate events.  

On the [Metrics page][1], the [Element Detail panel][2], and [Event Explorer][3], the colors of data points in metric charts indicate the type of data that is shown.

| DP Color | Description |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <i class="fa fa-circle" style="color:black;"></i> | Black data points indicate **aggregate data** or data that has been interpreted by Metricly. To generate aggregate data, Metricly averages the data collected from a given integration at 5 minute intervals. |
| <i class="fa fa-circle" style="color:gray;"></i> | Gray data points also indicate **aggregate data** but for data collected that Metricly averages at 1 hour intervals.                                                                                          |
| <i class="fa fa-circle" style="color:green;"></i> | Green data points indicate **sparse data** or data generated by Metricly when data is not collected from a integration within a given period of time. The metric value for sparse data is always 0.           |
| <i class="fa fa-circle" style="color:red;"></i> | Red data points indicate a **deviation** or data that falls outside the learned Contextual or Baseline bands.                                                                                                 |
| <i class="fa fa-circle" style="color:blue;"></i> | Blue data points indicate **raw data** or data that has not been interpreted by Metricly. Because raw data is not interpreted by Metricly, it does not produce deviations.                                    |
