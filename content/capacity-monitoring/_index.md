## About Capacity Monitoring

[Capacity Monitoring](https://www.metricly.com/monitoring/) provides IT professionals the opportunity to catch performance bottlenecks and pinpoint where and why these performance issues occur.  The alerting process is fully automated, using preset multi-conditional policies based on industry best practices for every AWS resource type.

## Alerts
Alerts are a continuous series of events. They group anomalous behavior and enable you to view open (active) or closed (inactive) incidents. The Open Policies list is the first you see when navigating to the Alerts menu. This list is updated every 30 seconds.

You can **view**, **edit**, and **create** policies in this menu; you can also **enable notifications** for policies. Clicking on a policy name expands its details, such as conditions and associated elements.

## Events
Events are violations that have met all of a policy’s conditions for a set duration. They indicate that CloudWisdom has detected anomalous behavior in your environment. You can **view**, **categorize**, and **analyze** events. Organized most-to-least recent, finding the right event is easy.

You can zoom in on a series of events by clicking and dragging across the timeline.
