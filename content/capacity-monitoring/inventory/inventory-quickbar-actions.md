The inventory page allows you to quickly navigate through all of your [elements][1], sort, and perform bulk actions. The Inventory Explorer displays all the elements in your environment that were processed in the last hour. Elements are removed from the elements table roughly seven hours after an associated datasource is disabled.

## Use the Quick Bar
Select the elements youâ€™d like to edit using the checkboxes on the far left of each row. After a checkbox is selected, the Quick Bar appears.

Then, select one of the following actions:

- View [Metrics][2]
- Add/Delete Tag
- Start/Stop Maintenance
- Delete Elements

## Delete Elements
Once you delete an element the metadata will be permanently removed. This cannot be undone. Historic time series data for that element will still be kept. If an element with the exact same metadata appears in Metricly, the available data for the element will be associated with it.
