This silences all attached notifications for the policies selected for a set duration. You can manually unmute a policy at any time as well.

1. Select all policies you wish to mute.
2. Click **Mute Notifications**.
3. Input a mute duration and click **OK**. Your selected policies will remain muted until your chosen duration expires or when you manually unmute them.
