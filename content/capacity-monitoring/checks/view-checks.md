Leveraging our saved filters is a good way to find your checks. All checks are tagged with the **key**  `n.checks` and **value** `check name`.

1. Click **Type** and select either `SERVER` (for Linux) or `WINSRV` (for Windows) to pick where the check has been configured.
2. Navigate to **More** > **Tag** and search for `n.checks`.
