Checks are used to determine the state or health of infrastructure resources, services, or applications.

Dynamic and customizable, Checks allow you to define a time duration and then notify you when that state change occurs. Checks can be completely custom built by you or leverage our OOTB checks.

## Prerequisites
You must have already installed and configured a Windows and/or Linux agent to set up checks.

{{% notice tip %}}
We recommend you update your agents to their latest version before using this document.
