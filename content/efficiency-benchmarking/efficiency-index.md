Metriclyâ€™s Efficiency Indexing provides an at-a-glance view of your optimization scores in terms of:
- average cost per unit (e.g., cost per CPU in the case of EC2s)
- average per-unit utilization in various dimensions (e.g., Utilization of CPU, Memory, I/O).
- an index score ranking your efficiency against fellow peers in the cloud

Simply graph your improvements by watching cost-per-unit decreasing and utilization-per-unit increasing over weeks and months.

## AWS Daily Cost

Track your total AWS Daily Cost.

## AWS CPU Utilization

Get a per-instance breakdown of your CPU Utilization across your AWS accounts. This value goes up as you continue to right-size resources.

## The Efficiency Index

The Efficiency Index generates a score by dividing your total EC2 utilization by the average cost per element. A lower score means better maximization of your cloud budget.
